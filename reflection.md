What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
What worked: Code run without reporting errors. All methods achieved their desired functions. 
What didn't work: when printing out inventories, the terminal printed the location storing the "computer object", instead of the detailed content this object holds. I guess this is because I imported the module, and if I list the attributes of "computer" in detail, perhaps the printout will be different.
